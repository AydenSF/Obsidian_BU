# Obsidian 
This folder uses the [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/download) note taking program. Download Obsidian and open the folder CCVault. Allow the extensions if you want.

# Description
This vault is for my notes on academic topics.

# Similar File and Folder Names
Git will not upload empty folder and Obsidian can not point to folders. So you may see a file in the folder with the same name.
