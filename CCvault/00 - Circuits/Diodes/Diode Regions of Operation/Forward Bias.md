In the forward bias the current though the diode is limited by the external circuit. The voltage across the on diode is approximately 0.7V ($V_{D}=0.7V$)

Observing the graph we can see in the forward bias the voltage has an exponential relation with the current. This is way the $V_{D}$ is approximated to 0.7 as very small increases in voltage can be very large increases in current.
