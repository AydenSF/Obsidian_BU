# Description 
A diode is a circuit component that determines the allowable direction of current flow

# Symbol

- $I_{D}$ is the direction of current flow
- $V_{D}$ is the direction of voltage drop

# i-v characteristics

## Real Diode

As $V_{D}$ increases the allowed current is able to flow 

## Ideal Diode

Having a ideal form allows for simple models of a diode

$I_{D}=f(V_{D})=\begin{cases}I_{D}=0,V_{D}<0\\I_{D}>0,V_{D}=0\end{cases}$
