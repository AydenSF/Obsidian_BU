When an ideal diode is on it is treated as a short circuit. When an ideal diode is off it is treated as an open circuit.

- $I_{D}$ is the direction of current flow
- $V_{D}$ is the direction of voltage drop
# Description 
A diode is a circuit component that determines the allowable direction of current flow

It has a linear effect on circuits
# i-v characteristics

$$I_{D}=f(V_{D})=\begin{cases}I_{D}=0,V_{D}\lt 0\\I_{D}\gt 0,V_{D}=0\end{cases}$$
