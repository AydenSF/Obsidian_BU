In the constant voltage model when the diode on of in the [[Forward Bias]], the voltage across the diode is 0.7
- $V_{D}=0.7$ 

then the diode is off or in the [[Reverse Bias]] the voltage is 0
- $V_{D}=0$ 

there is no [[Breakdown Zone]] in the constant voltage model

When using the constant voltage model the diode becomes a voltage source.
