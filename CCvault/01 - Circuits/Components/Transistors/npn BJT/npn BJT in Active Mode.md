The [[Forward Bias]] of the Emitter Base Junction (EBJ) injects electrons from the emitter into the base. Small number of holes injected form the base into emitter.

The [[Base Region]] is very thin ($W$ is small). 


Electrons enter the [[Collector Region]] are absorbed by the positive battery terminal
