# Current

$$I_{D}=I_{S}\left[ \exp\left( \frac{V_{D}}{nV_{T}} \right)-1 \right]$$

For $V_{D}\gt 0.5V$

$$I_{D}\simeq I_{S}\exp\left( \frac{V_{D}}{nV_{T}} \right)$$
$I_{S}$ is a temperature dependent constant. It doubles for every 5C. It is called the [[Saturation Current]]. ($I_{S}$ is on the order of $10^{-9}$ to $10^{-15}$A)

$V_{T}=\frac{KT}{q}$ is the [[Thermal Voltage]]. $V_{T}\simeq 25mV$ at room temperature. $T\simeq 300K$. K is [[Boltzmann's Constant]]. 

$q=1.6\times 10^{-19}C$ is the magnitude of the electron charge

n is a constant with a value between 1 and 2 depending on the material and the physical structure of the diode
