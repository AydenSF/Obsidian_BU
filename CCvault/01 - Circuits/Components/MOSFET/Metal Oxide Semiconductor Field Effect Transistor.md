The MOSFET is the most commonly used transistor

is a [[Transistors|Three-terminal Device]] with
- gate
- source
- drain

Two types
- nMOS
- pMOS


The source and the drain are interchangeable 

nMOS drain is low volt, source is high volt
pMOS drain is high volt, source is low volt



Three regions or operation
- Cutoff
- Triode or linear region
- Active or Saturations
