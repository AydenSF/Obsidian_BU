is a three terminal device 


to use as switch don't use in active region. use in saturation region.

when in saturation region beta will drop

beta force?

beta in active = Ic2/IB2 or = 
look at graph 

beta in saturation Ic2sat/IB2\<B


we operate in saturation region to save power
use more base current to use a higher curve to get a better saturation region.
