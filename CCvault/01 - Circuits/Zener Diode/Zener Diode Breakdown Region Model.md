A zener diode can be modeled by a resistor and a voltage source ($V_{Z0}$). The resistor is the [[Incremental Resistance]] ($r_{Z}$).

- $I_{Z}$ is the current in the line
- $V_{Z}$ is the voltage change over the resistor and the source
- $V_{Z0}$ is the source
- $r_{Z}$ is the resistance


Because this diode is in the [[Breakdown Region]] the voltage change will always be greater than the [[Knee Voltage]]. Same for the [[Knee Current]].

$$V_{Z}\gt V_{Zk}$$
$$I_{Z}\gt I_{Zk}=I_{Zmin}$$
Where
$$V_{Z}=V_{Z0}+r_{Z}I_{Z}$$
