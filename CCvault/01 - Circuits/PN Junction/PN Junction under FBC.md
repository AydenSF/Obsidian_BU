FBC = [[Forward Bias]] Condition
OCC = Open Circuit Condition

The pn junction is in forward bias when the [[n type semiconductor|n type]] region is at a lower potential than the [[p type semiconductor|p type]] region.

The external voltage creates a field direction from p side to the n side. This is opposite to the built-in voltage from the OCC [[PN Junction under OCC#PN Junction Built-in Voltage]]

The external voltage lowers the potential barrier by weakening the field. This allows and increase in the diffusion currents.
