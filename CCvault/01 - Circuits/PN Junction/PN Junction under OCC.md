# Current Flow Across Junction: Diffusion


![[Pasted image 20250224084410.png]]

Where 
$n_{n}=N_{D}=$ density of electrons on the n side (Majority carriers)
$p_{n}=\frac{n_{i}^2}{N_{D}}=$ density of holes n the n side (Minority carriers)
$p_{p}=N_{A}=$ density of holes on the p side (Majority carrier)
$n_{p}=\frac{n_{i}^2}{N_{A}}=$ density of electrons on the p side (Minority carrier)


# PN Junction Built-in Voltage

Built-in voltage develops to oppose the diffusion.

With no external voltage applied the voltage can be found by
$$V_{0}=V_{T}\ln\left( \frac{N_{A}N_{D}}{n_{i}^2} \right)$$
Where
$N_{A}$ and $N_{D}$ are the respective doping concentrations of the p and n side of the junctions. 

For typical silicon at room temperature $V_{0}=0.6\sim 0.8$
