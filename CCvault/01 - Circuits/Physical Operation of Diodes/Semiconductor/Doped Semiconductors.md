Doping silicon is the act of introducing ions into the material. 

Doped silicon in which the majority of the charge carriers are the negatively charged electrons called the [[n type semiconductor]].

Silicon doped so that the majority of charge carriers are the positively charged holes is called [[p type semiconductor]].
