Conventional AM is a DSB signal with the a transmitted carrier. This means the signal is transmitted with a copy of the carrier and it exists on both sides of the spectrum.

$$s(t)=A_{c}\cdot m(t)\cdot c(t)+c(t)\cdot A_{c}$$

can also be written as 

$$s(t)=A_{c}[1+m(t)]c(t)$$

where 

$$c(t)=\cos(2\pi f_{c}t+\phi_{t})$$ 

If $m(t)\gt 1$ for some t the signal must be normalized. As to keep the [[Envelope]] above 0. // explain envelop somewhere 

$$m_{n}(t)=\frac{m(t)}{max\mid m(t)\mid}$$

$$s(t)=A_{c}[1+am_{n}(t)]c(t)$$ 

$a$ is the modulation index it is selected such that

$$m_{n}(t)\cdot a+1\ge 0$$
