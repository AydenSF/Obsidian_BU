# $\Omega$ - Space of events

## Subset 
A subset is when all element of a set are also an element of another set. 

$A\subset \Omega$

The case $A=\Omega$ is possible but the previous is a proper subset while this is less so. // unsure

$A\subseteq \Omega$

## Superset
Of course the opposite is true when a set contains all the elements of another. It is then a superset.

The equation also becomes flipped

$\Omega \supset A$
