To prove a systems [[Linear Systems|Linearity]] you take 2 inputs $x_{1}(t)$ and $x_{2}(t)$ 

Using the 2 inputs evaluate 
$$S[ax_{1}(t)+bx_{2}(t)]$$ and $$aS[x_{1}(t)]+bS[x_{2}(t)]$$

Then for the system to be considered linear  $$S[ax_{1}(t)+bx_{2}(t)]=aS[x_{1}(t)]+bS[x_{2}(t)]$$
//maybe?
System (S) take functions as inputs not just t. So S(x(t)) and x(t) will be replaced in y(t). then say S(x(t)) where x(t) = x(t-t0) this gets y(t) = x(2t). x(t) = x(t-t0) where x(2t) t is input into x(2t-t0)
