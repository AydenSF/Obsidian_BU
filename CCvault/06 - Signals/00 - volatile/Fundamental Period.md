To find the fundamental period identify all periodic terms in the function. Then find all the periods of the terms. Once found take the [[Least Common Multiple]] of the periods.

$$T_{0}=lcm(T_{1},\dots,T_{n})$$ ![[Pasted image 20250301165036.png]]
// fix later

for more complex $$LCM\left( \frac{a}{b},\frac{c}{d} \right)=\frac{LCM(a,c)}{gcd(b,d)}$$
