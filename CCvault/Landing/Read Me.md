# Obsidian 
This folder uses the [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/download) note taking program. Download Obsidian and open the folder CCVault. 

# Description
This vault is for my notes on topics. These could be from anything from games to school.


# Similar File and Folder Names
Git will not upload empty folder and Obsidian can not point to folders. So you may see a file in the folder with the same name. 

# Class Description
This may have a class tag eg. Class III. This is not a rating of the topics difficulty (directly at least) more of a vague idea of how much other content is needed or used in it.

# Warning 
There may be spelling, grammar, information errors. 
There may be swears
